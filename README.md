# demo_Linux_bash

This is the big assignment of course `Linux Program Design`(2017 summer vacation semester), which is open by Ji Jiangmin, Zhejiang University.

This project implements a demo Linux bash using several Linux bash. Thus, this program has to be compiled and executed under Linux environment.

This bash contains several commands such as cd, pwd and so on. The details can be found in file `readme`(however, it is in Chinese, since the teacher of the course prefer the Chinese documents, so what a pity)

the code is in `main.c` and `main.h`. The comments of the code are both in Chinese and in English
